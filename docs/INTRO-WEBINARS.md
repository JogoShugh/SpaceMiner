# Dev/Volunteer Intro to SpaceMiner

A number of developers who volunteer with Coder Dojo Ponce Springs have asked us about the open source SpaceMiner software that we use during events. SpaceMiner helps beginners start coding quickly with simple, declarative code and share their progress with peers and parents instantly.

They've heard about SpaceMiner's success in a number of Atlanta-area schools and in after-school programs would like to grab a copy of the code so they can use it too. Some developers have also been eager to contribute to the project, and we would love the help and are accepting pull-requests on GitHub!

Please join us in person or on-line for a three-part series about SpaceMiner to see how you can contribute and help our students grow their knowledge of coding!
