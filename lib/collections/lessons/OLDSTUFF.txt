        `OK, but what is a <b>value</b>? You've already seen many examples of values. When you typed <code>var worldName = "My Awesome World!"</code> you were telling the program to put the <b>value</b> of <i>"My Awesome World!"</i> into the variable named <code>worldName</code> so that it could display it on the screen when you or others play your game. In this case the value's <b>type</b> is called a <b>string</b>, because it is a a series of letters or other characters contained inside of two <code>"</code> (double-quote> characters. Can you think of other places where you have already encountered <b>values</b>?`,

        `If you said that when you wrote <code>var numberOfLives = 50</code> and <code>var enableEnemyRespawn = false</code>, you are correct. In these cases, the value <i>50</i> has a type of <b>number</b>, and the value <b>false</b> has a type of <b>boolean</b> -- remember that a <b>boolean</b> value can only ever be one of two possible values: <b>true</b> or <b>false</b>.`,

        `Actually, everything in your world is made of some type of <b>value</b> already, even the more complicated ones. For example, imagine that you decided to make the <code>worldRows</code> variable contain dozens of gems and just a few coins, like this:
<br>

<pre><code>var worldRows = [
"gggggggggggggggggg",
"gggggggggggggggggg",
"gggggggggggggggggg",
"gggggggggggggggggg",
"ggggggccccccgggggg",
"ggggggccccccgggggg",
"ggggggccccccgggggg",
"ggggggccccccgggggg",
"ggggggccccccgggggg",
"gggggggggggggggggg",
"gggggggggggggggggg",
"gggggggggggggggggg"
]</code></pre>

In this case, you have used multiple <b>string</b> values grouped together as a special kind of single value called an <b>Array</b>. An Array is a value that lets you combine multiple other values into a single place and in a specific order. Each of the individual items in the array is normally called an <b>element</b>.`,

        `There are lots of things that occur in the real world that computer programs would normally store in <b>Array<b> values. Here are some examples that I can think of:
<ul>
<li>A grocery shopping list, where each item to purcahse is a single element</li>
<li>The names of all the capital cities of each country on planet Earth, or on your own worlds!</li>
<li>Directions to the nearest bathroom from where you are currently sitting, where each element is the number of feet to walk and in what direction</li>
</ul>`,

        `Think for a moment about some other things in the room you're in now or in the world that a computer program might store in an <b>Array</b>. What did you come up with?`,
