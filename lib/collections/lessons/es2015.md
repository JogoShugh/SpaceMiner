# Learn ES2015 and Beyond with SpaceMiner

Beginners who want to write games with HTML5 and JavaScript of today (ES5) have to come to grips with challenging concepts like recursion, asynchronous game loops, and callback hell. But, ES2015 and ES2016 brings powerful new features to simplify asynchronous programming while also reducing the cognitive burden for beginners and seasoned pros!

# ES2015 and Beyond

Learn about how ES2015 and beyond will powerup your code!

## Write and run tomorrow's code today

SpaceMiner allows developers and students to start learning and using ES2015 and even proposed 2016 features today. This is done with the <a href='https://babeljs.io/' target='_blank'>Babel compiler</a>, loaded inside the web browser.

Here is a <a href='https://babeljs.io/docs/learn-es2015' target='_blank'>great list of features in ES2015</a>. In short, here are some features to look forward:

* arrows
* classes
* enhanced object literals
* template strings
* destructuring
* default + rest + spread
* let + const
* iterators + for..of
* generators
* unicode
* modules  
* module loaders
* map + set + weakmap + weakset
* proxies
* symbols
* subclassable built-ins
* promises
* math + number + string + array + object APIs
* binary and octal literals
* reflect api
* tail calls

## How Meteor already uses Babel

You can learn more about how the Meteor team is already making use of Babel internally and how you can too in this recent DevShop video by Ben Newman:

## Babel supports the `async / await` ES2016 proposal already!

In addition to completed ES2015 spec features, Babel supports experimental features of ES2016. See the <a href='https://babeljs.io/docs/usage/experimental/' target='_blank'>list of those features here</a>. SpaceMiner utilizes the `async / await` proposal to great effect, as you'll soon see!

Jafar Husain from the Netflix team has an excellent talk from JSConf 2015 on <code>async / await</code> that you don't want to miss:

## The pain of today's JavaScript and asynchronous code

But first, let's start with today's JavaScript, technically named ES5, and the callback hell situation to see why this is such a problem when beginning students approach programming for the first time.

# ES5 and callback hell

Passing functions to functions to functions gets old and cumbersome very quickly. See how ES2015 mitigates this problem with simpler syntax for declaring functions.

## Asynchronous code an callback passing

The problem of making naturally asynchronous code, like code executing within a game loop or network access code, feel synchronous in JavaScript is often handled by callbacks. This is when you pass a reference to function A to function B that you want function A to call when it has finished some asynchronous work. It gets really complicated if you want to sequence a large number of steps together.

Here's an example from SpaceMiner in which we instruct the player on screen to make several moves in sequence:

${program('', \`move(point(0,0), function() {
  move(r(3), function() {
    move(d(3), function() {
      move(l(3), function() {
        move(u(3));
      });
    });
  });
});\`, true)}

## Replace `function() {` with `() => {`        

ES2015 helps mitigate this problem by removing the need to type `function() {` boilerplate. Instead, you can use the new fat arrow function declaration syntax of `() => {`. That swaps 12 keystrokes for 6. In some cases, as you'll see in a moment, you can even just type `() => `, omitting the curly brace. Regardless, still are wrapped in callback hell as the parentheses pile up on the right side:

${program('', \`move(point(0,0), () => {
  move(r(3), () => {
    move(d(3), () => {
      move(l(3), () => {
        move(u(3));
      });
    });
  });
});\`, true)}
