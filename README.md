# SpaceMiner

SpaceMiner is a tool to help beginner programming students learn JavaScript and programming concepts in face-to-face or remote environments, with peer collaboration and mentor/teacher assistance.

## Questions we're trying to address

* How can you get beginners started quickly, and within one hour have them produce a result that's:
  * Shareable 
  * Fun
  * Unique
  * Resumable at home or next time
* How can we as mentors understand how well our tutorials and lessons are helping students make real progress?
* How can students help each other improve and collaborate?
  * And, how can we hook them on "that old time agile" mindset?

## Current use

* [CoderDojo Ponce Springs](http://www.meetup.com/CoderDojoPonceSprings/)
* [Mental Fitness Atlanta](http://www.mentalfitnessatl.org/)

## Current features (all WIP!)

* Play worlds made by other students immediately without needing to login
* Create an account (without needing an email address)
* Fork and modify existing worlds and modify the world map and event handlers for collisions
* Step-by-step tutorials for learning JavaScript within the context of building a world
  * Interactive lessons for improving understanding of concepts
    * With questions to test knowledge
    * Coding challenges before advancing
    * Mentor / Teacher interactive dashboard to monitor class progress and understanding
* Ability to send a world into "Test" to get others to play it and leave feedback
* Ability to "release" a world into "Production" (and soon to get ratings and stastics about difficulty, average time per play, etc)

## Planned features

* Multiple-player mode within a world
* Save world code into GitHub directly from the tool
  * With ability to re-deploy previous versions of a world when desired
* Custom "plugins" via Quintus component model
* Support for creating **Student Teams** and **Class Sessions** to aid Mentor / Teacher dashboards for running multi-week sessions
* Support for intelligently pairing students with peers based on quiz scores and on peer-to-peer code reviews
