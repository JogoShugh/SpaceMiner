# Learn ES2015 and Beyond with SpaceMiner

Beginners who want to write games with HTML5 and JavaScript of today (ES5) have to come to grips with challenging concepts like recursion, asynchronous game loops, and callback hell. But, ES2015 and ES2016 brings powerful new features to simplify asynchronous programming while also reducing the cognitive burden for beginners and seasoned pros!

# ES2015 and Beyond

Learn about how ES2015 and beyond will powerup your code!

## Write and run tomorrow's code today

SpaceMiner allows developers and students to start learning and using ES2015 and even proposed 2016 features today. This is done with the <a href='https://babeljs.io/' target='_blank'>Babel compiler</a>, loaded inside the web browser.

Here is a <a href='https://babeljs.io/docs/learn-es2015' target='_blank'>great list of features in ES2015</a>. In short, here are some features to look forward:

* arrows
* classes
* enhanced object literals
* template strings
* destructuring
* default + rest + spread
* let + const
* iterators + for..of
* generators
* unicode
* modules  
* module loaders
* map + set + weakmap + weakset
* proxies
* symbols
* subclassable built-ins
* promises
* math + number + string + array + object APIs
* binary and octal literals
* reflect api
* tail calls

## How Meteor already uses Babel

You can learn more about how the Meteor team is already making use of Babel internally and how you can too in this recent DevShop video by Ben Newman:

## Babel supports the `async / await` ES2016 proposal already!

In addition to completed ES2015 spec features, Babel supports experimental features of ES2016. See the <a href='https://babeljs.io/docs/usage/experimental/' target='_blank'>list of those features here</a>. SpaceMiner utilizes the `async / await` proposal to great effect, as you'll soon see!

Jafar Husain from the Netflix team has an excellent talk from JSConf 2015 on <code>async / await</code> that you don't want to miss:

## The pain of today's JavaScript and asynchronous code

But first, let's start with today's JavaScript, technically named ES5, and the callback hell situation to see why this is such a problem when beginning students approach programming for the first time.

![Callbacks in your callbacks](http://i.imgur.com/DEg3cPZ.png)

# ES5 and callback hell

Passing functions to functions to functions gets old and cumbersome very quickly. See how ES2015 mitigates this problem with simpler syntax for declaring functions.

## Asynchronous code and callback passing

The problem of making naturally asynchronous code, such as code executing within a game loop or network access code, feel synchronous in JavaScript is often handled by callbacks. This is when you pass a reference to function A to function B that you want function A to call when it has finished some asynchronous work. It gets really complicated if you want to sequence a large number of steps together.

Here's an example from SpaceMiner in which we instruct the player on screen to make several moves in sequence:

${training('boxStep', 'es2015-es5-callbacks', \`move(point(0,0), function() {
  move(r(3), function() {
    move(d(3), function() {
      move(l(3), function() {
        move(u(3));
      });
    });
  });
});\`)}

## Replace `function() {` with `() => {`

ES2015 slightly mitigates this problem by removing the need to type `function() {` boilerplate. Instead, you can use the new fat arrow function declaration syntax of `() => {`. That swaps 12 keystrokes for 6. In some cases, as you'll see in a moment, you can even just type `() => `, omitting the curly brace. Regardless, we still are wrapped in callback hell as the parentheses pile up on the right side:

${training('boxStep', 'es2015-es2015-arrows', \`move(point(0,0), () => {
  move(r(3), () => {
    move(d(3), () => {
      move(l(3), () => {
        move(u(3));
      });
    });
  });
});\`)}

## Curlyless arrow functions

ES2015 can take us further by removing the need for `{` and `}` because when you declare an arrow function that just executes a single expression, you can just leave them out. Note that this implicitly makes the function `return` the value of the single expression.

${training('boxStep', 'es2015-es2015-arrows-curlyless', \`move(point(0,0), () =>
  move(r(3), () =>
    move(d(3), () =>
      move(l(3), () =>
        move(u(3))
      )
    )
  )
);\`)}

## Inline arrow functions

Finally, ES2015 lets us condense this down to a single line if we want:

${program('', 'move(point(0,0), () => move(r(3), () => move(d(3), () => move(l(3), () => move(u(3)))));', true)}

${training('boxStep', 'es2015-es2015-arrows-condensed')}

## Can't get no...

Yet, this still feels unsatisfying, as we are still in good old callback hell.

# Promises, Promises

Promises allow us to flatten the callback chain out, a vast improvement. However, there is still a lot of boilerplate.

## Promises in SpaceMiner

Promises are built into ES2015, and even in ES5 we can utilize them with libraries. Here's a first step at using Promises in SpaceMiner with ES5:

${training('boxStep', 'es2015-es2015-promises', \`move(point(0,0))
.then(function() { return move(r(3)); })
.then(function() { return move(d(3)); })
.then(function() { return move(l(3)); })
.then(function() { return move(u(3)); });\`)}

## Less boilerplate in ES2015 for Promise chains

And, with ES6, the boilerplate disappears and we can write it this way:

${training('boxStep', 'es2015-es2015-curlyless-promises', \`move(point(0,0))
.then(() => move(r(3)))
.then(() => move(d(3)))
.then(() => move(l(3)))
.then(() => move(u(3)))\`)}

## What about picking up all gems?

Getting better, but there's more...

![Wait there's more!](http://www.35again.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/weight-loss-coffee.jpg)

# ES2016's magical async / await

So far we've seen just how to pick up one group of gems, but now let's see how to grab all of them, starting with doing it in ES5 and then show the amazing features of ES2016 that will dramatically simplify this.

## A beginner student's logical attempt at a for loop

This is code similar to what was written by a 10-year-old girl during her first time at a CoderDojo event. She had the correct idea, right? Try it out and see if you can pinpoint the problem, however. Do you understand why?

${training('boxStep', 'es2015-es5-student-for-loop', \`for (var row = 0; row < 3; row++) {
  var x = row \* 7;
  for (var box = 0; box < 3; box++) {
    var y = box \* 4;
    console.log('Moving ship to X and Y coordinates: ' + x + ':'  + y);
    move(point(x, y));
    move(r(3));
    move(d(3));
    move(l(3));
    move(u(3));
  }
}\`)}

## Using Promises in ES5 to solve the problem

To actually do this in ES5, we can use Promises, but it does not look good for a beginner!:

${training('boxStep', 'es2015-es5-pickup-promises', \`var x = 0,
    y = 0,
    total = 9,
    done = 0,
    distX = 7,
    distY = 4;
var pickup = function() {
  if (done < total) {
    var nextX = x + (distX \* (done % 3));
    var nextY = y + (distY \* Math.floor(done / 3));
    console.log('Moving ship to X and Y coordinates: ' + nextX + ':'  + nextY);
    move(point(nextX, nextY))
    .then(function() { return move(r(3)); })
    .then(function() { return move(d(3)); })
    .then(function() { return move(l(3)); })
    .then(function() { return move(u(3)); })
    .then(function() {
      done++;
      pickup();
    });
  }
}
pickup();\`)}

## ES2015 provides some sugar here, but nothing dramatically new

ES2015 helps us here slightly, but not much. I threw in one small improvement that I have in `move` that I didn't mention before.

${training('boxStep', 'es2015-es2015-pickup', \`const x = 0,
      y = 0,
      total = 9,
      distX = 7,
      distY = 4;
let   done = 0;
let pickup = () => {
  if (done < total) {
    var nextX = x + (distX \* (done % 3));
    var nextY = y + (distY \* Math.floor(done / 3));
    console.log('Moving ship to X and Y coordinates: ' + x + ':'  + y);
    move(point(nextX, nextY), r(3), d(3), l(3), u(3), pickup);
    done++;
  }
};
pickup();\`)}

## ES2016: It's magic!

In this previous code, I manually implemented Promise support inside the `move` function, so we don't have any new language construct at the ES2015 level that does anything special for us. The code inside the `move` function that facilitates using Promises is also non-trivial for beginners!

But, this where the 2016 `async / await` proposal shines, as you'll see next...

## The awesome ES2016 async / await proposal

While the `async / await` feature is <a href='https://github.com/lukehoban/ecmascript-asyncawait' target='_blank'>still in the proposal status</a>, you can use it today with Babel. <a href='http://babeljs.io/docs/usage/experimental/' target='_blank'>See here for more info on how to use it with Babel</a>.

Do this:

* Execute it with the `await` keyword in place
* Delete the `await` keyword and execute it again

Essentially, the `await` keyword signals to the interpreter that what follows is a Promise, and instead of requiring you to manually chain its result into a new function via the `.done(...)` function on the Promise, it transparently does all this for you. Additionally, where you normally would add a `.catch(...)`, you can now happily just use a standard `try {} catch() {} finally { }` block!

${training('boxStep', 'es2015-es2015-async-await', \`for(let box = 0; box < 9; box++) {
  let x = 7 \* (box % 3);
  let y = 4 \* Math.floor(box / 3);
  console.log('Moving ship to X and Y coordinates: ' + x + ':' + y);
  await move(point(x, y), r(3), d(3), l(3), u(3));
}
alert('And, now we are done!');\`)}
